\section{Data Application}\label{sec:data}

The data in our example represent the orientations of cubic crystals on a Nickel surface measured by electron backscatter diffraction. The data were obtained using a 14-fold technical replicate in each location. 
A central interest in EBSD data is the identification of so-called {\it grain maps} -- grains are defined as regions on the surface with nearly identical main direction $\bm S$. This makes the estimation of $\bm S$ crucial to the field. 

\blue{
After applying all four of our estimators to each location on the surface, we found -- surprisingly -- large differences between the estimates in some of the locations. 
Figure \ref{fig:eyeballs-1} shows sphere plots of the data and the estimates for one of these locations.    Note that the figure shows a sample of a single location, yet the clustering in the data suggests very clearly the presence of \emph{several} main directions. The same holds true for locations in the vicinity. This happens to coincide with the boundary between grains. 

The  median estimates, $\ProjMedian$  and $\GeomMedian$, are not nearly as much affected by the clustering in the sample as the means, and reliably estimate the main direction of the largest group of rotations within the sample.
