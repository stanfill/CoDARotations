\section{Data Application}\label{sec:data}

We consider electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data obtained by scanning a fixed  12.5 $\mu$m $\times$ 10 $\mu$m nickel surface at individual locations spaced 0.2 $\mu$m apart. This scan was repeated 14 times for each location yielding a total of 3,449 observations, \citep{bingham09, bingham10b}. Every observation corresponds to the orientation, expressed as a rotation matrix, of a cubic crystal on the metal surface at a particular location. One goal of processing ESBD data is to identify the main orientation of cubic crystals in the metal, where graphs of cubic crystals with similar orientations constitute ``grains'' on the metal surface, thus making the estimation of the main direction $\bm S$ for a sample of rotations relevant here.

At every location, using the 14 repeat scans  we computed the misorientation angle $|r|=\Rdist(\widehat{\bm{S}}, \bm I_{3\times 3})$ of the four estimators ($\widehat{\bm{S}}= \ProjMean$, $\ProjMedian$, $\GeomMean$, and $\GeomMedian$) to compare resulting differences in the corresponding estimates.  In the following we will focus particularly on the differences between $\ProjMean$ and $\ProjMedian$ as the Riemannian estimators  $\GeomMedian$ and $\GeomMean$ largely agree with their Euclidean counterparts. 

The left hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:grain-map} illustrates the implementation of $\ProjMedian$: each location on the plot is colored according to the mis-orientation angle between  the estimate $\ProjMedian$  and the identity $\bm I_{3\times 3}$ (as an arbitrarily chosen reference point).  The plot shows a distinct spatial structure resembling a grain map. On the right hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:grain-map} we illustrate the difference between $\ProjMean$ and $\ProjMedian$ at each location. The difference in estimates is again defined with respect to the mis-orientation angle between both estimates and locations are colored accordingly.

Note that the literature, e.g. \cite{bingham10b}, suggests that distances of $0.5^\circ$ degrees are indicative of different grains. In our example, about 10\% of the locations result in a difference between $\ProjMean$ and $\ProjMedian$ estimates of at least that size. Differences tend to be largest along boundaries between the spatial structures on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:grain-map}  (i.e.~identifying boundaries). 

Table~\ref{tab:rotations} provides an explanation for the observed differences between $\ProjMedian$ and $\ProjMean$ along the spatial structure in Figure~\ref{fig:grain-map}. The table contains the observed orientation (collection of all nine coefficients $x_{ij}$, $1 \le i,j \le 3$, of the $3\times 3$ rotation matrix) for each of the 14 repeated scans at the location with the largest observed difference between $\ProjMedian$ and $\ProjMean$, namely 22.3$^\circ$.   The scans have been re-ordered to better illustrate  the clusters of orientations observed at this particular location. The clusters suggest that, for this location on a ``grain boundary,'' a subset of the scans likely picked up the orientation of a neighboring cubic crystal  belonging to a different grain. A median-type estimator naturally does better for such data with ``outliers'' than a mean-type estimator.

We visualize Table~\ref{tab:rotations} and the estimates resulting from applying $\ProjMedian$ and $\ProjMean$ at this location in Figure \ref{fig:pcp} using a parallel coordinate plot: for every scan each of the nine coefficients $x_{ij}$ ($1 \le i,j \le 3$)) is plotted separately. Coefficients that correspond to the same scan are connected by a line.   Note that the coefficient values are jittered using a small perturbation in form of a rotation matrix to avoid over-plotting and to illustrate cluster sizes. The light- and dark green colored line represent the $\ProjMedian$ and $\ProjMean$ estimates of the main direction based on the 14 scans.   This example  illustrates that the median estimate, $\ProjMedian$,  can more reliably estimate the main direction in the presence of potential anomalies on the spatial boundaries of grains.
