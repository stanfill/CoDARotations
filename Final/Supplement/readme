Code and data for 'Point Estimation of Random Rotations in SO(3)' by Bryan Stanfill, Ulrike Genschel and Heike Hofmann

'FullFinalResults.csv' contains the simulation results used to create some of the figures and tables in the manuscrip.  It is read into the R code also in this folder.  The columns 
names are as follows: 
	'Dist' represents the distribution corresponding to that sample
	'nu' is the sample's circular variance
	'n' is the sample size
	'HL1Error' is the arc-distance between the geometric median and the true centeral orientation
	'HL1Iter' is he number of iterations required for convergence
	'ML2Error' is the arc-distance between the geometric mean and the true centeral orientation
	'ML2Iter' is he number of iterations required for convergence	
	'ArithError' is the arc-distance between the projected mean and the true centeral orientation
	'MedError' is the arc-distance between the projected median and the true centeral orientation
	'MedIter' is he number of iterations required for convergence
	'Sample' is the sample number

'Nu75TailBehavior.csv' contains the results necessary to create Figure 6 in the manuscript
	'Dist' represents the distribution corresponding to that sample
	'Prop' is the proportion of observations in the tail as defined in Section 5
	'PMean' is the arc-distance between the projected mean and the true centeral orientation
	'PMedian' is the arc-distance between the projected median and the true centeral orientation
	'Pdiff' is the difference between the errors (PMean-PMedian)
	'GMean' is the arc-distance between the geometric mean and the true centeral orientation
	'GMedian' is the arc-distance between the geometric median and the true centeral orientation
	'Gdiff' is the difference between the errors (GMean-GMedian)
	'n' is the sample size
	
'RotationsFiguresCode.R' contains all the code necessary to reproduce the simulation results, figures and tables in the manuscript.  The R code used to create the tables and figures
in the Data Application are also included, but the data file needs to be obtained from its owner, Dr. Melissa Bingham currently at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse.
