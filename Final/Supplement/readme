Code and data for 'Point Estimation of the Central Orientation of Random Rotations' by Bryan Stanfill, Ulrike Genschel and Heike Hofmann

'FullFinalResults.csv' contains the simulation results used to create some of the figures and tables in the manuscrip.  It is read into the R code also in this folder.  The columns 
names are as follows: 
	'Dist' represents the distribution corresponding to that sample
	'nu' is the sample's circular variance
	'n' is the sample size
	'HL1Error' is the arc-distance between the geometric median and the true centeral orientation
	'HL1Iter' is he number of iterations required for convergence
	'ML2Error' is the arc-distance between the geometric mean and the true centeral orientation
	'ML2Iter' is he number of iterations required for convergence	
	'ArithError' is the arc-distance between the projected mean and the true centeral orientation
	'MedError' is the arc-distance between the projected median and the true centeral orientation
	'MedIter' is he number of iterations required for convergence
	'Sample' is the sample number

'Nu75TailBehavior.csv' contains the results necessary to create Figure 6 in the manuscript
	'Dist' represents the distribution corresponding to that sample
	'Prop' is the proportion of observations in the tail as defined in Section 5
	'PMean' is the arc-distance between the projected mean and the true centeral orientation
	'PMedian' is the arc-distance between the projected median and the true centeral orientation
	'Pdiff' is the difference between the errors (PMean-PMedian)
	'GMean' is the arc-distance between the geometric mean and the true centeral orientation
	'GMedian' is the arc-distance between the geometric median and the true centeral orientation
	'Gdiff' is the difference between the errors (GMean-GMedian)
	'n' is the sample size
	
'RotationsFiguresCode.R' contains all the code necessary to reproduce the simulation results, figures and tables in the manuscript.  The R code used to create the tables and figures
in the Data Application are also included.  Load the RData file 'datasetnickel.RData' into your current R session to run this portion of the code.


'datasetnickel.RData' is an R-data file consisting of the dataset used in the Data example section of the paper
	'xpos' are the x-axis positions of each data point
	'ypos' are the y-axis positions of each data point
	'data' is a 14-by-9-by-3449 maxtrix.  The first index denotes each of the fourteen scans.  
										  The second index denotes each element of the 3-by-3 rotations matrices.  
										  The third index corresponds to the x-y position at the corresponding position in 'xpos' and 'ypos'.
