To estimate the central orientation $\bm S$ given a random sample of three-dimensional orientations from \eqref{eqn:1} the scientific literature suggests a variety of approaches. These approaches differ largely with respect to the geometry (Riemannian vs.~Euclidean) in which the estimation is done, assumptions about the underlying data-generating mechanism and the choice of loss function when defining suitable estimators. The main goal of this paper was to explore the extent to which the above mentioned differences affect the estimation of $\bm S$. 
Our simulation study showed that the choice of loss function depends on the underlying data-generating mechanism.  For the circular-von Mises-based model median-type estimators are recommended while for the Cayley and matrix Fisher model the mean-type estimators show less estimation error and variability. As noted in Section~\ref{ch:intro} the applied sciences generally pursue estimation of $\bm S$ without considering the distributional underpinnings. This can be a pitfall. Restricting ourselves to the three rotation distributions under consideration,  if indeed nothing is known about the underlying data-generating mechanism we suggest to use either median-type estimator, i.e. $\ProjMedian$ or $\GeomMedian$. The overall estimation error, even under mis-specification will be much less than the potential estimation error resulting from either mean-type estimator. The correct choice of geometry also depends on the underlying distributional model, however, the effects are not as large. The Riemannian distance metric  $d_G$ is generally not to recommend with a mean-type estimator due to the resulting increase in variability in the estimation errors. This fact holds across all three distributions  and is much expressed than for any of the other three estimators.
Lastly, the extent to which all four estimators disagree relative to each other depend on the circular variance $\nu$; the estimators differ more when $\nu$ is large and tend to agree more and more as the data become more concentrated.  
   
The scope of this study can be extended to other frequently encountered distributional model, especially because we restricted the simulation to symmetric perturbations around $\bm S$ in \eqref{eqn:1}. At least as important, if not even more is the extension of the studied point estimators to interval estimators. The latter requires a significant improvement in computing time before it can be practically implemented. Both of these tasks will be pursued by the authors in the near future.\\
