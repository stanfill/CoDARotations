\section{Recommendations and Conclusions}\label{sec:disc}

The scientific literature suggests a variety of approaches to estimate the central orientation $\bm S$ given a random sample of three-dimensional orientations from \eqref{eqn:1}. These approaches differ largely with respect to the geometry (Riemannian vs.~Euclidean) of estimation, assumptions about the underlying data-generating mechanism, and the choice of loss function when defining suitable estimators. The main goal of this paper was to explore the extent to which these choices affect the estimation of $\bm S$. 
Our simulation study showed that  the underlying data-generating mechanism guides our choice of loss function.  For the circular-von Mises-based model median-type estimators perform better while for the Cayley and matrix Fisher model the mean-type estimators show less estimation error and variability. As noted in Section~\ref{ch:intro} the applied sciences generally pursue estimation of $\bm S$ without considering the distributional underpinnings. Restricting ourselves to the three rotation distributions under consideration,  if indeed nothing is known about the underlying data-generating mechanism we suggest to use either median-type estimator, where the proposed median, the Euclidean based estimator $\GeomMedian$, emerges as a good overall choice. Its overall estimation error, even under mis-specification, will be much less than the potential estimation error resulting from either mean-type estimator. The extent to which all four estimators disagree depends on the variability in the rotation data; the estimators differ more when the circular variance $\nu$ is large and tend to agree more as the data become more concentrated.  
   
\noindent Further studies could be extended to include location estimation in non-symmetric distributional models for rotations as we considered common models for symmetric perturbations around $\bm S$ in \eqref{eqn:1}. Another important consideration is the extension of the studied point estimators to building confidence regions for the location parameter $\bm S$. One possibility would be resampling-based confidence regions, but this requires theoretical development for the estimator's sampling distributions and improvements in computing time before this can be practically implemented. \\
